// Unlike other featureful cfg files, this one is truly a config file executed as server command.
// It must adhere to the engine cfg format, therefore cvar values must be written in quotation marks.

// Default pushable mode for func_pushables. 0 is original HL. 1 is Xash3D. 2 is Spirit of Half-Life.
pushablemode "0"

// Default item pickup policy. 0 is by touch only (like in HL), 1 is by pressing +use only. 2 allows picking up the item by both touching and pressing +use.
pickup_policy "0"

// Triangulation depth to use when building paths for monsters. Possible values: 1, 2, 3. Note that higher values may affect the performance.
npc_tridepth "1"

// If set to 0, only player's followers and monsters in scripts will use the value specified by npc_tridepth as the triangulation depth, and other monsters will use the value 1.
// If set to 1, all monsters will use the value specified by npc_tridepth. Note that this may affect the performance.
npc_tridepth_all "0"

// If monster didn't observe its enemy for this amount of time (in seconds), the monster forgets about their enemy. Setting 0 means that monsters never forget their enemies (i.e., the standard behavior in Half-Life).
npc_forget_enemy_time "0"

// If set to 1, monsters will wander around a bit after the combat ends.
npc_active_after_combat "0"

// Attempt to fix item_ and ammo_ entities falling physics. This is experimental as some values lead to other bugs.
// 0 - default Half-Life behavior (items fall through thin shelves)
// 1 - items dropped from func_breakable boxes placed on thin shelves don't fall through. Items still fall through if box is in the air.
// 2 - same effect as 1 plus items don't fall through thin shelves at the level start. But prespawned items start to fall through clip brushes.
// 3 - same effect as 1 plus fix for boxes in the air. Items don't fall through thin shelves, but they fall through clip brushes no matter whether they're prespawned or come from func_breakable.
items_physics_fix "0"
